# hybrid-search-demo
Demo project showcasing hybrid retrieval pipelines (BM25 + dense embeddings) with synthetic data.

I worked on building a scalable data retrieval pipeline.

Problem: Retrieval latency + messy data.  
Approach: Hybrid search (BM25 + embeddings + ColBERT), caching, evaluation framework.  
Results: Reduced latency (qualitative), built local demo used by DSA team.  
Lessons: Hybrid search tradeoffs, data cleaning, working with GPUs.  
Next: Public repo (scrubbed), post, reflection.
